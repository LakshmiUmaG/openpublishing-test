# Welcome to Dali! ##

Dali City, formerly known as Tali, is the county-level seat of the [Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dali_Bai_Autonomous_Prefecture) in northwestern [Yunnan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yunnan),

Similar to [Carlisle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Carlisle) in [England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England), Dali City is not a single city but a county-sized area called a city for administrative purposes. Transportation to "Dali" usually arrives at the modern industrial city called Dali but locally distinguished by its former name [Xiaguan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiaguan,_Dali_City). Travelers to and discussion of "Dali", however, usually refers to the old town located about an hour away. The old town is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Yunnan, known for its natural scenery, historical and cultural heritage, and vibrant nightlife.
